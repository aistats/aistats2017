<h2>Registration</h2>

<p><b>
It is important to complete both Step 1 (filling out a form) and Step 2 (payment). 
If any of these steps are missing, you are not considered as registered and will be required to complete it at the conference registration desk, subject to higher cost for on-site registration. 
</b><br>

<h3>Step 1: Filling out a form</h3>

Please fill out <A onclick="window.open(this.href); return false;" href = "https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdHwF6XCxLL96bWQzWtg1mLmZl-vfEJjhpgDq6jdGN-vhGsjw/viewform">this form</a>. 

<br>

<h3>Step 2: Online payment</h3>

<p>Please select a registration option below. Please make sure that
    the amount of payment matches to your registration option in Step
    1. <b>Those who register at a student rate should present their
    student ID or equivalent document at the registration desk.</b><p>

<p>Please make sure either to <b><font color="red">pay with a credit card in your name</font></b> or to <b><font color="red">provide the same Paypal e-mail address used in Step 1</font></b> when you fill the form during payment.
