<h3>Limitations on International Travel:</h3>

<p>AISTATS is committed to an open international exchange of information, which is critical to the continuing advance of scientific knowledge. Our goal is to open AISTATS conference to researchers from all parts of the world and we regret that government restrictions may make it difficult or impossible for some to participate this year. <i>In the event that no author of an accepted paper can attend due to visa restrictions, we will find ways for authors to present their results via the internet.</i></p>
